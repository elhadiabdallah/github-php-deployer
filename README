Details for "GitHub PHP Deployer" Application

This application intends to make it easier to deploy and manage PHP websites 
from github.com by using public API of downloading branches.

========= How it works? ========= 
 - Basically, it will download the branch from github as a zip file, uncompress
and install it as a revision into your server and make it available for deployment
with the directory name you want. The same github.com can be used by multiple
users, multiple branches, multiple projects and multiple names.

========= How to install? ========= 
 - Just create a directory into your PHP server and drop the 'index.php' file 
in it. Since there are no authentication implemented for the application, i truly 
recommend using a .htaccess file into the directory where you dropped the 'index.php'
file, to avoid people deploy everything on your server ;-)

========= How to use? ========= 
 - There a few parameters that should be specified within query string. These 
parameters are:
   - These parameters are mandatory:
     - 'owner' = The owner user name of the project at github.com [e.g.: rafaelkarst];
     - 'project' = The project name at github.com [e.g.: archiveclipboard-web];
     - 'branch' = The branch name, [e.g.: master];
   - This parameter is mandatory only to enable deployment:
     - $name = The name of the directory you want to deploy a revision [e.g.: test];
   - This parameter is used only to programmatically deploy a revision;
     - 'revision' = the name of the revision at github.com [e.g.: rafaelkarst-archiveclipboard-web-6775b86]
 - Normally you'll need to specify only the following parameters to get
   "GitHup PHP Deployer" running:
     - 'owner' = The owner user name of the project at github.com [e.g.: rafaelkarst];
     - 'project' = The project name at github.com [e.g.: archiveclipboard-web];
     - 'branch' = The branch name, [e.g.: master];
     - $name = The name of the directory you want to deploy a revision [e.g.: test];
 - The other functionalities are part of the application itself;

========= Examples ========= 
 - Import the latest revision from github.com related to the project:
   - http://<YOUR_SERVER>/git/?project=archiveclipboard-web&branch=master&owner=rafaelkarst&name=test [GitHub PHP Deployer Default Page for project]
   - http://<YOUR_SERVER>/git/archiveclipboard-web/master/test/ [After deployment of revision, it will become available here]
   - https://github.com/rafaelkarst/archiveclipboard-web [this is where "GitHub PHP Deployer" will import branch];
